# 🩺 Simulated LLM Responses to Clinical Vignettes

This Streamlit app simulates a large language model (LLM) providing answers to clinical vignettes and related diagnostic questions. **It does not use a real LLM**, but instead displays pre-scripted responses for educational or research use. The app begins with a consent form and collects some basic diagnostic or user data before allowing the selection of vignettes.
